# Navmesh AI Tutorial 29 - NavMeshAgents Hiding and Taking Cover

Learn how to make NavMeshAgents find valid cover spots from another target object. In this video we'll specifically use a Player, but this can be applied to hide from any object - a grenade for example. Together we'll create a configurable script that allows us to refine which objects are valid to hide behind, and exclude those that are not. 

We'll add the following possible configurations:
* Layers of objects to consider for cover, and to hide FROM
* Radius to check for objects to hide behind, and FROM
* Size of objects to hide behind
* Distance from object cover must be 
* How good of a hiding spot it must be to take cover
* How frequently to check for new hiding/cover spots
